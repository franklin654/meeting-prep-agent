## Decisions and safeguards

- Stage 0 backup: `/home/saisivakesh/meeting-prep-backups/app.db.pre-overhaul`, SQLite `integrity_check` passed.
- Tag: `pre-ui-overhaul` at `459f871`.
- Leave `deliverables/` untracked. Never read, edit, or commit `.env`; never use the real-DB API on port 8000.
- The current server was unavailable during Stage 0. The checked-in generated OpenAPI client is the baseline contract until offline generation is run.
- Per the user's explicit resolution of the conflict with AGENTS.md rule 9, commits that change a schema, table, endpoint, or error code may update only the matching portions of `docs/data-model-and-schemas.md`; all other conflicts belong in this file.
- A0: `MEMORY_READ_ONLY` defaults off. The real and fake memory gateways reject every write (`ensure_bank`, `ensure_mental_models`, meeting/note/preference retains) with `memory_read_only` before issuing an SDK call. Provider adapters now log provider, model, `json`/`text` call type, and provider-reported prompt/completion token counts only.
- A1: Added only the requested additive tables (`extractedfact`, `capturedraft`, `meetingprepared`, `memoryoverride`) and their repository gateways. No `create_all` call was run against `backend/app.db`.
- A2: Added account/contact creation and listing, meeting scheduling/cancellation, prepared markers, and enriched meeting summary metrics. Added `ae_name` and `company_name` to health using the seeded company file; Docker API mounts `./data` read-only at `/data` for the same source. Regenerated `frontend/src/api/schema.d.ts` offline from `app.openapi()` (17 paths). No new error codes.

## Live-call and token tally

| Operation | Calls | Prompt tokens | Completion tokens | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| App LLM | 0 | 0 | 0 | — |
| Hindsight retain | 0 | — | — | — |
| Hindsight reflect | 0 | — | — | — |
| Brief generation | 0 | — | — | — |
| Pattern refresh | 0 | — | — | — |

## B4–C4 plan addendum

| Ticket | Primary files | Endpoint/model additions | Main risks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| B4 | `api/contacts.py`, new `api/memories.py`, new `api/commitments.py`, `services/profile.py`, `services/ask.py`, `services/brief.py`, `db/facts_repo.py`, `db/overrides_repo.py`, `db/commitments_repo.py`, `schemas/api.py`, `schemas/patterns.py`, `llm/prompts/derive_patterns.md`, tests | `GET /api/contacts/{id}/profile`; `POST/DELETE /api/memories/{id}/hide`; `POST /api/memories/{id}/correct`; `PATCH/DELETE /api/commitments/{id}`; `POST /api/contacts/{id}/patterns/refresh`; `ContactProfile`, `MemoryOverride`, `ContactPattern` | Overrides must consistently filter profile, brief evidence, and Ask without claiming to delete a Hindsight memory. Pattern output must validate fact ids and never run automatically. |
| B5 | `pages/Contacts.tsx`, `pages/ContactProfile.tsx`, `components/*`, `api/hooks.ts`, `api/keys.ts`, `routes.tsx`, UI tests | consumes B4 contracts | Confirmed destructive follow-up operations; source chips must use title plus date, never ids. |
| C1 | `pages/Ask.tsx`, `components/AskPanel.tsx`, routes, hooks, UI tests | no new backend contract expected | Scope changes cannot leak account context; preserve the existing drawer and in-memory three-turn history. |
| C2 | new `api/memory.py`, `services/memory_overview.py`, `db/facts_repo.py`, `memory/memory_service.py`, `schemas/api.py`, `pages/Memory.tsx`, hooks/tests | `GET /api/memory/overview`; `MemoryOverview` | Hindsight statistics must be read-only, short-timeout, and nullable on failure; chart uses only real SQLite data. |
| C3 | all affected pages/components, `index.css`, responsive/accessibility tests | none | Keep 4.5:1 contrast, keyboard access, and three target widths without new client storage. |
| C4 | verification scripts/tests only; `docs/ui-overhaul-notes.md` | none | Do not exceed the live-call budget or write to real Hindsight outside the authorized pattern refreshes; backup only after verification. |

## Planned Checkpoint 2 evidence

- Sandbox-W: one first-meeting P3 brief, one pattern refresh, fact hide/correct, follow-up edit/delete, prepared state.
- Sandbox-R: at most two M6 memory brief generations, record latency/recall timeouts/critical count and verify read-only Hindsight behavior.
- Read cached M6 on the real-memory data path before generation to prove zero-call enrichment.
